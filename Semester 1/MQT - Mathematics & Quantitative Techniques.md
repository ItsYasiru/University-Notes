# 01. Introduction to Algebra

Algebra? *Language of variables. Ex: x, y, z*
	Algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols in formulas.
	<br>
Algebraic Expression?
	A combination of operations on letters (variables) and numbers is called an algebraic expression.
	<br>
	Components of an algebraic expression,
		$$ 3x - 2y + 7 $$
		- Terms: 3x, 2y, 7
		- Variables: x, y
		- Constant: 7
		- Coefficient: 3, 2
		- Operators: -, +
	<br>
Order of operations: `(), ^, /, *, +, -`
	- Brackets
	- Order
	- Division
	- Multiplication
	- Addition
	- Subtraction

# 02. Numbers & Operations

\[ R \] Real Numbers: Any number
	- \[ P/Q \] Rational Numbers: Presented as fractions. 
		*Ex: 0.5, 1/2*
		- There are 2 types of rational numbers,
			- Terminating *Ex: 1, 2.0, 0.55*
			- Repeating *Ex: 1.111111...., 0.512222....*
		<br>
		- \[ I \] Integers: Whole numbers & Zero.
			- \[ N \] Natural Numbers: All positive integers.
		<br>
	- \[ P”/Q” \] Irrational Numbers: Can't be presented as fractions. 
		*Ex: 0.12791931927394820106....*
	<br>
Real numbers can further be classified into/represented with,
	- Prime Numbers: Only divisible by itself excluding 1.
		*Ex: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17*
		<br>
	- Surds/Radicals: Convenient way to represent irrational numbers. 
		*Ex: √2 = 1.4123423135635....*
		<br>
	- Indices: Shorthand way write multiplications of the same number.
		*Ex: 2^10 = 1024*
		<br>
	- Fractions: Part or portion of a whole
		- Properties of fractions,

# 03. Exponents & Radicals

Exponents/Indices/Powers? Shorthand way of representing a number repeatedly multiplied by itself.
	*Ex: X²*
	- Where it has a base (X) and an exponent/power/index (2).
	<br>
	- Theorem 1: A negative/positive exponent is equal to it's reciprocal inverting it's signum.
		*Ex: X⁻² = 1/X²*
	- Theorem 2: Multiplication and Division of indices with same bases correspond to Addition and Subtraction of their index respectively.
		![[Pasted image 20220916194948.png]]
		![[Pasted image 20220916195020.png]]
	- Theorem 3: Power of a power can be simplified by multiplying the indexes.
		![[Pasted image 20220916195302.png]]
			- Negative or Irrational indexes can be represented as a  reciprocal of it's surd.
				![[Pasted image 20220916195504.png]]
				<br>
	- Theorem 4: Power of 0 will evaluate the term to 1, disregard of the base. *Ex: X⁰ = 1*
	- Theorem 5: All terms within a bracket must be applied to its power before operating on them.

		![[Pasted image 20220916200151.png]]
	<br>
Surds/Radicals? Inverse exponents for irrational/negative indexes. 
	*Ex: 4^(1/2) == √4*
	- Surds follow the same rules followed by exponents only visually being different from operations are carried out.
		 √a x √b
		= a^(1/2) x b^(1/2)
		= ab^(1/2)
		= √ab
		![[Pasted image 20220916201317.png]]
		= a^(1/2) / b^(1/2)
		= 1 / -ab^(1/2)

# 04. Introduction to Quantitative Techniques

Quantitative techniques? Statistical and Programming techniques which help decision makers solve problems with systematic and powerful means of analysis based on quantitative data.
	1. Statistical Techniques
		Used in conducting the statistical inquiry concerning a certain phenomenon. It includes all the statistical methods beginning from the collection of data till the task of interpretation of the collected data. Collection, Classification, Summarizing, Analyzing, Interpretation of the data.
		<br>
	2. Programming Techniques
		Used by many decision makers in modern times First designed to tackle defense and military problems and are now being used to solve business problems, It includes variety of techniques like linear programming, game theory, simulation, network analysis, queuing theory and so on.

Role of quantitative techniques in business and industry,
	- They provide a tool for scientific analysis
	- They provide solutions for various business problems
	- They enable proper deployment of resources
	- They help in minimizing waiting and service costs
	- They enable the management to decide when to buy and how much to buy
	- they assist in choosing an optimum strategy
	- They render great help in optimum resource allocation
	- They facilitate the proves of decision making
	- Through various quantitative techniques management can know the reaction of integrated business systems

Statistics as a process,
	1. Collecting data
	2. Organizing and Presenting data
	3. Analyzing data
	4. Interpreting data

Data vs Information
	Data?
		- An individual unit that contains raw materials which does not have any specific meaning.
		- Data does not depend on information.
		- Raw data alone in meaning less in terms of making decisions.
		<br>
	Information?
		- Group of processed data that collectively carries a meaning.
		- Information depends on data.
		- Information is sufficient for decision making.

Data collection and sampling,
	- Population? All objects on which we have to make some study.
	- Sample? Number of observations selected from the population in some prescribed manner for a systematic study.
	<br>
	- Parameter? A number that descries an aspect of the population.
	- Statistic? A number that describes an aspect of a sample.

Branches of statistics,
	1. Descriptive Statistics
		Branch that includes methods and techniques used in collection, organization, presentation and analysis of data in order to describe the various features and characteristics of such data.
		<br>
	2. Inferential Statistics
		The branch of statistics that involves inferring or drawing conclusions about the characteristics of the population based upon the results of the sample taken from the same population.
		<br>
		In other words,
			Inferential statistics deals with the methods of generalizing the results obtained from a sample to the whole population.

Role of quantitative techniques in Business management
	- It helps directing authority in optimum allocation of various limited resources like, labor, machines money, material, time etc...
