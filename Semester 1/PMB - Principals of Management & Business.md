# 01. Operations Management

The process of managing the resources that create & deliver services & products & appropriate use of resources to create outputs that fulfill a defined market requirement can be defined as Operations Management.

What are the resources that we are talking about?
	Materials, Human resources, Information, customers, Financial resources, facilities.

What does it mean by appropriate use of resources?
	- Efficient: Use of resources while getting the tasks done is the right manner with the minimum time with the minimum cost incurred & with no wastage of resources.
	- Effectiveness: Achieving a target & setting goals in right direction, doing the right thing.

What are the outputs? The product & the service.

Operations in an organization,
	- Core functions
		- Marketing/Sales function
			> Responsible for communicating the organizations' products & services to its market in order to generate customer requests.
			> Responsible for producing new & modified products & services in order to generate future customer requests.
		- Operations function
			> Responsible for the creation & delivery of services & products based on customer requests.
		<br>
	2. Support functions
		- These enable the core functions to operate effectively. 
		- Different organizations have various support functions & will call by different names for their convenience.
		<br>
		- No clear division between the three-core function or between core & support functions. Difficult to define boundaries of the operations function.
		- The responsibility of support function is primarily to make sure that they understand & operations' needs & help them to satisfy these needs.
		<br>
		- Technical function
		- Accounting & finance function
		- Human resource function
		- Information systems function

Input - Transformation - Output process
	- Input: The resources invested in producing the product or service
		- **Transformed resources:** These are the resources that are treated, transformed or converted in the process. These resources can be found in the product. Its also possible to say that it is a mixture of Material, Information & Customers.
			<br>
			- Material
				- Operations which process materials could do so to transform their **physical properties**.
				- Operations process materials to change their **location**.
				- Operations, do so to change the **possession** of the materials.
				- Some operations **store materials**, such as warehouses.
				<br>
			- Information
				- Operations which process information could do so to transform their **informational properties**, which is the purpose or form of the information.
					Ex: Accountants
				- Some change the **possession** of the information.
					Ex: Market research companies sell information
				- Some store the information
					Ex: Libraries & Archives
				- Some operations change the location of the information.
					Ex: Telecommunication companies
				<br>
			- Customers
				- Some operations have inputs of materials & information & customers, but usually one of these is dominant.
				  Ex: Banks take money as input from customers
			<br>
		- **Transforming resources:** These are recourses that act upon the transformed resources, they are not found inside the product but they contribute the process.
			<br>
			> Facilities
				The buildings, equipment, plant & process technology of the operation.
				<br>
			- Staff
				The people who operate, maintain, plan & manage the operation. Note that the term 'staff' refers to all the people involved at any level
			<br>
		- All processes have transforming resources of facilities (equipment, technology, etc.) & people.
		<br>
	- Process: Arrangement of resources that create a mixture of service or product(s).
		- All operations consist of a collection of processes (though these processes may be called 'units' or 'departments') intercommunicating with each other to form a network.
		- Within any operation, the mechanisms that transform inputs into outputs are these processes.
		- A process is an arrangement of resources that create some mixture of service & product(s).
		- They are the 'building blocks' of all operations, & they form an 'internal network' within an operation.
		<br>
	- Output: The product/service that satisfies the market need
		- Product: Tangible things, most products can be stored.
		- Service: Activity of the customer using or consuming that product. Service only happens when it is consumed or used.
		<br>
		- Most operations produce both products and services.

Characteristics of operations process **(4v's)**
	- Volume: Number of units produced
		- Higher volumes encourage systemization of work and standard procedures leading to low unit cost.
		  Ex: McDonalds Burger production
		- Lower volume may lead to high cost per unit due to noy having standard procedures. However, repetition of work is low.
		  Ex: Small local cafeteria
		<br>
	- Variety: Ability to change the final product/service as per the customer requirements, flexibility.
		- Low flexibility allows standardization and low cost.
		- High flexibility allows high cost per unit.
		<br>
	- Variation: Change in the demand for the final product/service
		- It requires the operations capacity to be changes according to the demand.
		- Operations can be managed by planning activities in advance.
		  *Ex: Demand for hotel accommodation*
		  <br>
	- Visibility: How much of the operations activities is customer experience, or how much the operation is exposed to customers.
		- Customer processing operations are more visible than information processing operations.
		- Brick & Motor vs. Web Based
		- Mixing high/low visibility processes
	<br>
Operations performance objectives
	- Quality: Providing error free products/services which are 'fit for their purpose'.
		- Quality reduces costs,
			Fewer the mistakes made in the process less time needed to correct it.
			Ex: If a supermarket's regional warehouse sends the wrong goods to the supermarket, it will mean staff time - and therefore cost being used to sort out the problem.
			<br>
		- Quality increases dependability,
			It enhances the availability of the products & service.
			*Ex: If a supermarket's shelfs are out of stock that represent the inefficiency of the process. Thus, quality has internal impact which leads to stable and efficient processes.*
		  <br>
		<br>
	- Speed: Reduce the time lag between the order placing and receiving the good, thus increasing the availability.
		- Speed reduces inventories,
			Quality enhance the availability of the products and service. Like supermarkets, when the shelfs are running out of stock that represent the inefficiency of the process it has. Thus, quality has internal impact which leads to stable and efficient processes.
			<br>
		- Speed reduces risk and costs,
			Forecasting tomorrow's events is far less of a risk than  forecasting next year's. The further ahead companies forecast, the more likely they are to get it wrong.
		<br>
	- Dependability: Doing things on time, keeping the delivery promises.
	- Flexibility: Ability to change what you do being able to adopt the operations activities to give customized offerings.
	- Cost: Doing things cheap, produce at a cost which enabled them to obtain a return.
	<br>
What do operations managers do?
	 - Directing the overall nature and strategy of the operation.
	 - Designing the operations service, products and processes.
	 - Planning and controlling process delivery.
	 - Developing process performance.
