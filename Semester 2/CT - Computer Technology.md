# Introduction
What is a machine? 
	It is a physical system using power/energy to perform a certain task(s).

Normal Electronic machine vs Computer,
	- An electric machine is designed to perform one task.
	- A computer can be programmed to run different algorithms and accomplishes multiple tasks using it's memory.
	- Both are machines and they function under the same principal of Input, Process, & Output.
	- It takes input from an external system processes it and provides a desired output.

# Electricity
Common terms used in context of electricity,
	1. Voltage/Potential (V)
	2. Current (I)
	3. Resistance (R)
	4. Power (P)

## Voltage (V)
The level difference between the two points of any power source, it is measured in [Volt (V)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt).
$$ I = V / R $$

## Electric Current (I)
The current measures the rate of the flowing charges in a electric circuit. The unit used the measure the charge is [Coulomb (C)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb). One coulomb per second is called an [Ampere (A)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere).
	- Current flow is from positive to negative
	- Electron flow is from negative to positive

$$ I = V / R $$

>[!WARNING] Ohm's Law
> Current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it.
> $$ V =  IR $$

## Resistance (R)
The force against the current flow, it is measured in [Ohm's (Ω)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm). The electrical resistance of a circuit is the ratio between the voltage applied to the current flowing through it.

$$V ∝ IV = IR$$

## Power (P)
The rate in which electrical energy is transferred in a circuit, it is measured in [Watts (W)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt). Energy is usually measured by the power used over time.

$$Power = Voltage * Current$$

# Data Representation
Data can be anything that poses quantitative and qualitative properties. Data can be generated from multiple sources.
