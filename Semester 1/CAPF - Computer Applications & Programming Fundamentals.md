# 01. Introduction to Computing
<br>
Computer? Electronic device operating instructions stored in it's memory that can accept data, process it & output information.
	- Features of a computer,
		- Speed
		- Accuracy
		- Efficiency
		- Versatility: Can perform many tasks simultaneously
		- Storing & Retrieving
		<br>
	- Functions of a computer,
		- Data: Data is a raw and unorganized fact that requires to be processed to make it meaningful.
		- Information: Information is a set of data which is processed in a meaningful way according to the given requirement.
			Qualities of information,
				- Accuracy
				- Validity
				- Reliability
				- Timeliness
				- Relevance
				- Completeness
				<br>
		- Process: Series of instructions taken in order to construct meaningful information from data.

Computer System? *Hardware, Software & Liveware form a computer system*
	- Consists of Hardware components that have been carefully chosen so that they work well together and Software components that run in the computer with Liveware.
		![[Pasted image 20220917113503.png]]
	- Hardware? Tangible physical components of a computer system.
		- Input devices: Components that input raw data.
		- Processing devices: Components that manipulate data into information.
		- Output devices: Components that disseminate and display data, information.
		- Storage devices: Components that can retain data.
	<br>
Main components of a computer
	- Motherboard: Physical arrangement in a computer that contains basic circuitry and holds components together.
		- Typical motherboards consists printed circuitry PCB (Printed circuit board) making it very compact.
		![[Pasted image 20220917114307.png]]
		- Functions of the motherboard,
			- Acts as a central backbone of a computer which modular components are held together allowing them to communicate with each other.
			- Acts as a platform on which various expansion slots are available to install other devices.
			- Distributes power to various components.
			- Responsible for the coordination of various devices and maintaining an interface among them.
			<br>
		- Motherboard back panel & I/O Interfaces
			- PS/2: Used to connect a keyboard, mouse to the system.
				- Purple: Keyboard
				- Green: Mouse
				- In modern computers USB port replaced its functionality
				![[Pasted image 20220917114822.png]]
			- Parallel port: Used to connect a printer.
				- Consists of 25 holes
				- In modern computers USB port replaces its functionality
				![[Pasted image 20220917115143.png]]
			- HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface): Can be typically seen in laptops and GPUs' connects to visual and auditory devices.
				![[Pasted image 20220917115330.png]]
			- RJ 45 port: Connects to networking devices to provide a networking interface.
				![[Pasted image 20220917115507.png]]
			- Audio ports: Connects to audio devices with analog signals.
				- Used on analog audio devices that amplify the signal to needed levels.
				- In modern computers USB port replaces its functionality
			- USB (Universal Serial Bus Port): This port is used to connect many types of input and output devices.
				- This is a widely accepted standard across many manufacturers, hence "universal".
				![[Pasted image 20220917120628.png]]
			- Video port VGA (Video Graphics Adaptor): Connects monitors, projectors & multimedia devices.
				- Older standard that uses analog signals which was replaced by HDMI and Display ports.
				![[Pasted image 20220917120914.png]]
			- Serial port: Connects devices like modems and other networking devices.
				- Older standard that uses analog signals which was later replaced by RJ 45 port.

# 02. Computer Software

Software? Programs stored in a computer that contains a set of instructions to perform a specific task, that is intangible in nature.
	- It tells a computer what tasks to perform and how to.
	- They are written in languages that can be understood by the computer hardware.
	- Hardware would be a brainless body without software.
	<br>
Classification of computer software,
	- System software: A collection of complex programs written to control and operate the computer system.
		- It is the interface between hardware and application software
		- It includes programs that are mostly used to control the computer itself and hardware
		- It provides a platform to other software
		<br>
		- Operating system? 
			A set of programs that control the executing of application programs and acts as an intermediary between the user and the hardware.
			<br>
			*Ex: Windows 11, Mac OS, Linux, Linux Mint, Kali Linux*
			- It manages the computer hardware as well provide an environment for application programs to run.
			<br>
			- Functions of an operating system,
				- Process management
					OS allows the computer to operate multiple activities (processes) at once. Its allocates all the necessary resources for a process and manage them efficiently.
					<br>
				- Memory management
					OS makes sure that enough computer memory is allocated for each process operated by the computer.
					<br>
				- Device management
					OS is responsible for the management of all the peripheral devices connected to a computer system.
					<br>
				- File management
					OS manages the file system of the computer which allows us to save data in files and folders.
					<br>
				- Provide user interfaces
					OS provides user interfaces to input commands and instruction in a user friendly manner. Users can perform tasks using these interfaces, without using complex instructions.
					<br>
				- Security management
					Protecting the computer from different kind of attacks is managed by the OS to some extend.
				<br>
			- Types of Operating Systems.
				- Single-user *Ex: DOS, Windows 3x, Windows 95/97/98*
					Provides services to one person at a time.
					<br>
				- Multi-user *Ex: Windows server OS, Ubuntu Server*
					Allows multiple users to use a system simultaneously.
					Installed in networked environments where many users need to share resources such as files, printers in a network setup.
					<br>
				- Multi-tasking *Ex: MS Windows, Mac OS*
					Allows to run multiple processes at the same time.
					<br>
				- Real-time *Ex: MS Windows 2000, IBM OS/390*
					Installed in special purpose embedded systems used in scientific devices & small gadgets such as ATMs, Robots, Cars & Modems.
					Gives the output in real-time without any observable delays.
				<br>
		- Utility Software?
			Programs that help the functioning of the computer system maintenance tasks.
			They help managing the resources of the computer.
		<br>
	- Application software: Programs written to carry out more specific tasks.
		- Acts as the mediator between the end user and system software
		- Cannot run on it self, depends on system software to provide a runtime environment for it to execute.
		- They can't directly operate on hardware without system software
	<br>
	- System software sets a standard environment for application software to run on top of, without it application software will require more time to be developed since it should be able to execute with no system software across various types of hardware.
