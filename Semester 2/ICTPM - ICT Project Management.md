# Introduction
No exams just assessments for the module to qualify for the final exam. Need to design a user interface and a mock prototype for a CRM app of some sort.

What is a project?
	A project is any undertaking, carried out individually or collaboratively and possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim.
		- Performed by people.
		- Constrained by resources.
		- Planned, executed, & controlled.

## Operations vs Projects
They both are different, operations are ongoing and repetitive while projects are unique. A project is a temporary endeavor taken to create e a product or service.
	- Undertaken at all levels of the organization.
	- may involve one/many people.
	- Duration is fixed and may range from a week to years.
	- May involve a single unit of one organization or may cross boundaries across the organization to others.
	- Projects are critical to the realization of the performing organization's business strategy.

By the words,
	- 'Temporary' it means it has a definite end and as start.
	- 'Unique' it means the product/service is different from others in the same market area.

The projects' end can be either the when the projects objectives have been achieved or when it becomes clear when project objectives cannot be met. This does not apply to the product/service. Projects may have intended or unintended social, economic & environmental impacts that outlast the project it self.
